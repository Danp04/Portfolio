## About me
I graduated from English Philology with a specialization in teaching (EFL) in 2016. As part of my teaching practice, I was a teacher in Primary School and Junior High School. Then, I've been working as an English tutor giving private lessons at different language level in Poland. 

What's more, I spent half of a year being an Erasmus exchange student in [UCLM Cuenca](https://www.uclm.es/cuenca/educacioncu) where I've been also teaching English or dealing with translation.

Currently, I work as Sr Tech Writing Specialist at Honeywell Services Poland Sp.z.o.o. I am responsible for creating spare parts lists, quotations, and compilation of technical documentation for the customer. The product we are focused on is conveyor. Depending on the customer and the conveyor type (as there are many) I also deal with keeping the docu up-to-date. The documentation is written in German and then translated into other languages.

For the last 6 years, I worked in the photovoltaics industry at SMA Magnetics Sp.z.o.o, Modlniczka Poland, a branch of SMA Solar Technology A.G, Germany. I started in 2016 at the position of Junior Workflow specialist, and then as a Project administration specialist. Thanks to those positions at SMA Magnetics, I learnt how manufacturing industries operate, how to plan my tasks, and how to cooperate with Engineers or Management Board. What is more, I had an opportunity to take part in ERP system testing as it was being reimplemented throughout the whole company. I also cooperated with colleagues from Germany assuring on-time delivery of our orders. Due to Corona pandemic, the company dealt with delays in the supply of materials, lack of materials for production but all precautions have been implemented to protect the employees and our jobs.

 About technical writing, I found out by accident. I found it interesting as I always wanted to connect my linguistic background with practical IT skills. The fact is that there wasn't any official training in Poland concerning this profession. For a newbie trying to step into the field, lack of knowledge resources was a pain point. 

Fortunately, the first edition of postgraduate studies opened online in 2020 at Vistula University. Thanks to this course, I acquired certain skills needed for a tech writer job. The classes included:
* an overview of who a tech writer is and what he has to deal with
* working with tech comm tools: Markdown, MadCap Flare, Oxygen, MemoQ, SnagIt
* solid knowledge of IT documentation project management practices
* preparation for [ITCQF](https://itcqf.org/) certification

That inspired me to try applying for the job and change my current profession.
