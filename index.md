## About me
I graduated from English Philology with a specialisation in teaching (EFL) in 2016. As part of my teaching practice, I was a teacher in Primary School and Junior High School. Then, I've been working as an English tutor giving private lessons at different language level in Poland. 

As part of MA studies, I spent half of a year being an Erasmus exchange student in [UCLM Cuenca](https://www.uclm.es/cuenca/educacioncu) where I've been also teaching English.

Currently, I work as a Technical Writer in Unit4 Polska. We deliver different types of documentation to our customers and we also build our internal doc wiki. Our main tech writing tool is MadCap Flare.

For the last 6 years, I worked in the photovoltaics industry at SMA Magnetics Sp.z.o.o, Modlniczka Poland, a branch of SMA Solar Technology A.G, Germany. I started in 2016 at the position of Junior Workflow specialist, and then as a Project administration specialist. Thanks to those positions at SMA Magnetics, I learnt how manufacturing industries operate, how to plan my tasks, and how to cooperate with Engineers or Management Board. 
 
Technical Communication made me interested by accident. I always wanted to connect my linguistic background with practical IT skills. There wasn't any official training in Poland concerning this profession. For a newbie trying to step into the field, lack of knowledge resources was a pain point. 

Fortunately, the first edition of postgraduate studies opened online in 2020 at Vistula University. Thanks to this course, I acquired certain skills needed for a tech writer job. The classes included:
* an overview of who a tech writer is and what he has to deal with.
* working with tech comm tools: Markdown, MadCap Flare, Oxygen, MemoQ, SnagIt.
* solid knowledge of IT documentation project management practices.
* preparation for [ITCQF](https://itcqf.org/) certification

That inspired me to apply for the job and change my current profession.
