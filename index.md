## About me
I graduated English Philology with the specialization in teaching (EFL) in 2016. As the part of my teaching practice, I was a teacher in Primary School and Junior High School. Then, I've been working as an English tutor giving private lessons at different language level in Poland.

What's more, I spent half of a year being an Erasmus exchange student in [UCLM Cuenca](https://www.uclm.es/cuenca/educacioncu) where I've been also teaching English.

Currently I work in photovoltaics industry at SMA Magnetics Sp.z.o.o, Modlniczka Poland, a branch of SMA Solar Technology A.G, Germany. I started in 2016 at the position of Junior Workflow specialist, and now as a Project administration specialist.

I found out about technical writing by accident. The fact is that there wasn't any official training in Poland concerning this profession. For a newbie trying to step into the field, lack of knowledge resources was a painpoint. 

Fortunately, the first edition of postgraduate studies opened online in 2020 at Vistula University. Thanks to this course, I acquired certain skills which can help me get a job as a tech writer. The classes included:
* an overview of who tech writer really is and what he has to deal with
* working with tech comm tools: Markdown, MadCap Flare, Oxygen, MemoQ, SnagIt
* solid knowledge of IT documentation project management practices
* preparation for [ITCQF](https://itcqf.org/) certification

That inspired me to try applying for the job and change my current profession.
